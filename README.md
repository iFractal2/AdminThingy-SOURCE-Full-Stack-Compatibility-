# AdminThingy Source (created by Ryan Delisle)



# AdminThingy was designed to be a cross platform language executor to be referenced outside and inside any ROBLOX game the main source is inserted in to.
It functions as an administrative tool for games, as well as a detailed debugger for in-dev projects.
It has four interfaces
- Discord
- Website Terminal
- ExpressJS app prompt
- The ROBLOX in-game terminal

This project takes advantage of multiple languages, including:
PHP, MySql, JavaScript, ExpressJS, ReactJS, HTML, CSS, LuaU, Lua, DiscordJS

These interfaces can all communicate with roblox and each other remotely, supported by a self hosted server in LampStack configuration, allowing the user to execute commands, run code, view logs, and provide real time debugging without hassle. All of which include self stabilizing functions for catching redundancies, loop logging that can catch errors in external code in whatever game may have problematic code, and allows for quick, lightweight user management.
