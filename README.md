# AdminThingy Source (created by Ryan Delisle)


# The operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP.
# AdminThingy was designed to be a cross platform language executor to be referenced outside and inside any ROBLOX game the main source is inserted in to.
It functions as an administrative tool for games, as well as a detailed debugger for in-dev projects.
It has four interfaces
- Discord
- Website Terminal
- ExpressJS app prompt
- The ROBLOX in-game terminal

These interfaces can all communicate with roblox and each other remotely, allowing the user to execute commands, run code, view logs, and provide real time debugging
without hassle. All of which include self stabilizing functions for catching redundancies, loop logging that can catch error in external code in whatever game may have
problematic code, and allows for quick, lightweight user management.
